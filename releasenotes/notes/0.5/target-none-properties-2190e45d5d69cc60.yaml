    Fixed :meth:`.BackendData.coupling_map` and
    :meth:`.BackendData.drive_freqs` raising exceptions when the underlying
    backend has ``None`` for its coupling and qubit property entries. Also,
    changed :meth:`.BackendData.control_channel` to return an empty list rather
    than ``None`` when there is no control channel data.
    See `#1035 <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-experiments/issues/1035>`__.
