    The Qiskit Experiments 0.5 release brings various improvements and bug
    fixes. Notable changes include the visualization module for drawing figures,
    which replaces the previous plotting functionality. The speed of randomized
    benchmarking experiments has been significantly improved. The ``qubit`` and
    ``qubits`` input to experiments has been regularized to ``physical_qubits``,
    and support for ``qiskit-ibmq-provider`` has been deprecated in favor of
    :external+qiskit_ibm_provider:doc:`qiskit-ibm-provider <index>`. New experiments added include
    :class:`.MultiStateDiscrimination`, :class:`.ZZRamsey`,
    :class:`.MitigatedStateTomography`, and
    :class:`.MitigatedProcessTomography`, along with significant improvements to
    other tomography experiments. The documentation has been significantly
    refactored and introductory tutorials have been added.
