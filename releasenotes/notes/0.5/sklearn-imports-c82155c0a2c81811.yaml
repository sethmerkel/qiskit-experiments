    The importing of ``scikit-learn`` was moved from module-level imports
    inside of ``try`` blocks to dynamic imports at first usage of the
    ``scikit-learn`` specific feature. This change should avoid errors in the
    installation of ``scikit-learn`` from preventing a user using features of
    ``qiskit-experiments`` that do not require ``scikit-learn``. See `#1050
    <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-experiments/issues/1050>`_.
