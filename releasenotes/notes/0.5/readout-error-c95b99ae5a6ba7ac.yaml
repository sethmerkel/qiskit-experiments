features:
  - |
    Added a ``backend`` init kwarg to the :class:`.LocalReadoutError` and
    :class:`.CorrelatedReadoutError` experiments, and the
    ``physical_qubits`` kwarg has been made optional. If a backend is supplied without
    specifying physical qubits, the experiment will be initialized on all
    qubits for the backend.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed a bug in the :class:`~.LocalReadoutError` experiment where analysis
    would fail when run on an ideal simulator with no readout error. See 
    `Issue #992 <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-experiments/issues/992>`_
    for additional details.
