upgrade:
  - |
    ``qiskit-ibmq-provider`` is deprecated and has been dropped as a requirement. Interactions
    with IBM backends should use the :external+qiskit_ibm_provider:doc:`qiskit-ibm-provider <index>` package instead (must be installed
    separately; see the 
    `migration guide <https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/ibm-provider/tutorials/Migration_Guide_from_qiskit-ibmq-provider.html>`_
    for more details).
