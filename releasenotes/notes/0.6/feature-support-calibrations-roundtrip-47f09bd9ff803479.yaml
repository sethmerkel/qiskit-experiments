    A JSON data format has been added for saving a :class:`.Calibrations` instance.
    This leverages a custom JSON encoder and decoder to serialize 
    the entire calibration data including user provided schedule templates.
    Output JSON data is formatted into the standard data model which is intentionally
    agnostic to the calibration data structure.
deprecations:
  - |
    Saving :class:`.Calibrations` instance into CSV file was deprecated.
    This only provides serialization for limited set of calibration data,
    and loading from the local file is not supported.
  - |
    :meth:`.Calibrations.schedule_information` was deprecated.
    This method returns attached calibration templates in the string format,
    but this cannot be converted back to the original Qiskit representation.
    Now better serialization is provided with :meth:`.Calibrations.save` with JSON mode
    and it internally dumps these schedule in through QPY format.
  - |
    :meth:`.Calibrations.load_parameter_values` was deprecated.
    Since saving :class:`.Calibrations` instance into the CSV format was deprecated,
    the required data file to invoke this method will be no longer generated
    in future calibrations instance. Full calibration instance roundtrip 
    is now supported with the save and load method.
  - |
    :meth:`.Calibrations.config` and :meth:`.Calibrations.from_config` were deprecated.
    Now canonical data representation is generated for calibration by the
    newly introduced :mod:`~qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.save_utils` module, 
    and the legacy configuration dictionary is no longer used for JSON encoding.
