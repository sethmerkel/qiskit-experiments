    New figure options were added to the visualization module: ``xscale`` and ``yscale``. They
    represent parameters to the Matplotlib functions ``set_xscale`` and ``set_yscale``: ``log``,
    ``linear``, ``symlog``, ``logit``, and ``quadratic`` (the latter is an additional support
    for quadratic scaling).
