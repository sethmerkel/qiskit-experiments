    Fix calculation of weight for curve fitting. Previously the weights of data points to obtain
    the residual of fit curve were computed by the inverse of the error bars of y data. 
    This may yield significant weights on certain data points when their error bar is small or zero,
    and this can cause the local overfit to these data points. 
    To avoid this edge case of small error bars, computed weights are now clipped at 90 percentile. 
    This update might slightly change the outcome of fit.
