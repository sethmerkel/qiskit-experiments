    A ``device_component`` field that contains a list of device components used in the experiment
    has been added to experiment metadata. Experiments with non-qubit components should override the
    default value of all qubit components. See the :doc:`custom experiments tutorial
    </tutorials/custom_experiment>` for more details.
