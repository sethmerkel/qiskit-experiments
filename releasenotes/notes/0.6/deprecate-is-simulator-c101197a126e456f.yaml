    :attr:`.BackendData.is_simulator` has been deprecated.
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.BackendV2` does not provide a standard interface
    for determining if a backend uses a simulator. Calling code must determine
    if a backend uses a simulator through some other means. Qiskit Experiments
    does not treat simulator-backed backends differently from hardware backed
    ones.
