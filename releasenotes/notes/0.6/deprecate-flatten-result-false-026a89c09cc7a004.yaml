deprecations:
  - |
    Executing composite experiment and composite analysis with ``flatten_results=False``
    by default was deprecated. To create child experiment data, please explicitly 
    set ``flatten_results=False``. The default value of ``flatten_results`` will be
    changed to ``True`` in the next release.
