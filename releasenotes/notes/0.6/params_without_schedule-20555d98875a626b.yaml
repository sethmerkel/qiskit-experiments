    The variables ``__drive_freq_parameter__`` and ``__readout_freq_parameter__``
    have been removed from :class:`.Calibrations`. These variables were given special
    treatment which is inconsistent with the framework. To replace them a
    mechanism to define and add parameters without a schedule has been added to
    the basis gate library. This has the added benefit of making the API of 
    frequency calibration experiments more consistent with the other calibration
    experiments. Calibration developers can now add parameters to their library that are not 
    attached to a schedule in a meaningful way.
