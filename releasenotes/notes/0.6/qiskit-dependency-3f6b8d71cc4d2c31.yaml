    The dependency on ``qiskit-terra`` was replaced with a dependency on
    ``qiskit``. This change follows the move in upstream Qiskit to rename
    ``qiskit-terra`` to ``qiskit``. The minimum required version was increased
    from 0.24 for ``qiskit-terra`` to 0.45 for ``qiskit``. For more information on
    the renaming of Qiskit, see the `Qiskit repository renaming plan
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/RFCs/blob/5793e78dc8e4d8d17f8ef7fad789c6c5ebd3a061/0011-repo-rename.md>`__
    and the `Qiskit 1.0 migration guide <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/migration-guides/qiskit-1.0>`__.
