    Added a new experiment option ``clifford_synthesis_method`` to RB experiments,
    e.g. :class:`~.StandardRB` and :class:`~.InterleavedRB` so that users can
    plug in a custom Clifford synthesis algorithm used for generating RB circuits.
    Such a plugin should be implemented as a :class:`~.qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin.HighLevelSynthesisPlugin`
    (see :class:`~.RBDefaultCliffordSynthesis` for example).
  - |
    Updated :class:`~.InterleavedRB` so that it only accepts ``interleaved_element``
    consisting only of instructions supported by the backend of interest.

    Fixed a bug in circuit generation for three or more qubit Randomized Benchmarking where
    sampled Cliffords may be changed during their circuits synthesis
    (in the worst case, the resulting circuits may use qubits not in
    ``physical_qubits``). See issue
    `#1279 <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-experiments/issues/1279>`_
    for additional details.
