    New experiment :class:`.StarkRamseyXY` has been added.
    This is a variant of the :class:`.RamseyXY` experiment that characterizes 
    the qubit frequency offset under a Stark tone drive.
  - |
    New experiment :class:`.StarkRamseyXYAmpScan` has been added.
    This is a variant of the :class:`.StarkRamseyXY` experiment to estimate
    the required tone amplitude to cause a particular Stark shift.
    This experiment scans tone amplitude while fixing the Stark tone length,
    and fits the result with the dedicated fitter :class:`.StarkRamseyXYAmpScanAnalysis`.

    New experiment :class:`.StarkP1Spectroscopy` has been added.
    This is a variant of :class:`.T1` experiment to conduct spectroscopy of 
    qubit relaxation at different qubit frequencies.
    The spectroscopy data is just visualized with the dedicated analysis 
    :class:`.StarkP1SpectAnalysis`. A developer may subclass this analysis class to
    perform custom analysis on the spectroscopy data.
