    :class:`.ScatterTable` has been introduced as a drop-in replacement of :class:`.CurveData`.
    
    This is a data format to store intermediate data in curve analysis built on top of
    the pandas :class:`~pandas:pandas.DataFrame`. Each table row corresponds to a single data point, 
    and the table contains all data points generated by the :class:`.CurveAnalysis`.
    All properties and methods of :class:`.CurveData` are implemented for backward compatibility,
    but these will be removed in the future release.
  - |
    New analysis option ``fit_category`` is added to :class:`.CurveAnalysis` subclasses.
    This option controls which data subset within the :class:`.ScatterTable` 
    is used for the curve fitting.
upgrade_curvefit:
  - |
    The behavior of :class:`.CurveAnalysis` data processing was changed. 
    It used to raise ``DataProcessorError`` error when it encounters an experiment result
    which cannot be classified into any fit model, but this restriction was relaxed 
    and the analysis continues with unclassified data.
    Unclassified data is just stored as-is in the :class:`.ScatterTable` with 
    the null class ID assigned. Such data is ignored in the rest of analysis steps
    such as formatting, fitting, and visualization.

    Added the :meth:`~.CurveAnalysis._create_figures` method to the :class:`.CurveAnalysis` base class.
    A curve analysis subclass can overwrite this method to customize the output figures.
    The method is called with the :class:`.ScatterTable` containing all intermediate data points 
    generated during the curve analysis.
