    Figure names have been updated to include qubit indices up to the first five device components in
    the experiment, with format ``StandardRB_Q0_Q1_Q2_Q3_Q5_b4f1d8ad.svg``. For composite
    experiments where ``flatten_results`` is set to ``True``, the head of the figure name is now the
    class name of the experiment instead of ``ParallelExperiment`` or ``BatchExperiment``, such that
    the figure name is the same when ``flatten_results`` is ``False``. The behavior when a figure
    name is repeated and ``overwrite`` is ``False`` has changed from throwing an exception to
    appending a numerical suffix to the figure name like ``StandardRB_Q0_Q1_Q2_Q3_Q5_b4f1d8ad-1.svg``.

    Figure metadata now includes ``experiment_type`` and ``device_components``.
