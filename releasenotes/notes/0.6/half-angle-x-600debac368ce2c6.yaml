    The :class:`.HalfAngle` experiment's circuits were changed so that they use
    combinations of ``rz`` and ``x`` instead of the less standard ``y`` gate.
    This change allows :class:`.HalfAngle` to be run on IBM backends directly.
    Previously, it could only be run through the :class:`.HalfAngleCal`
    subclass in combination with a :class:`.Calibrations` instance containing a
    custom calibration for the ``y`` gate.
    Fixes issue `#1233 <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-experiments/issues/1233>`_.
