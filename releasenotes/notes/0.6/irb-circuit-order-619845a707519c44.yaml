    A new experiment option ``circuit_order`` was added to :class:`~.InterleavedRB`.
    It allows to change the order of the reference and the interleaved circuits
    and hence slightly alter the impact of noise on interleaved RB results.
    The default value is set to ``"RIRIRI"`` that alternate a reference and
    an interleaved circuit.

    Changed the ordering of circuits generated by :class:`~.InterleavedRB` back to
    RIRIRI (R: Reference, I: Interleaved) order.
    It was accidentally changed into RRRIII order in
    `#898 <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-experiments/pull/898>`_.
    Before that, it had been RIRIRI order.
