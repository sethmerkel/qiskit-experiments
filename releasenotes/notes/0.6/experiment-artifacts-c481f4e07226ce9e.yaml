    An artifact class has been introduced to store long-form data generated by experiments.
    The :class:`.CurveFitResult` and :class:`.ScatterTable` generated by experiments 
    are now stored in artifacts in the :class:`.ExperimentData` class. :meth:`.add_artifacts`
    and :meth:`.delete_artifact` have been added to manipulate the artifacts. These will be uploaded
    to the cloud service in JSON form along with the rest of the :class:`.ExperimentData` object
    when saved. For more information, see the :doc:`artifacts how-to </howtos/artifacts>`.
deprecations:
  - |
    Setting the option ``return_data_points`` to ``True`` in curve analysis has been deprecated.
    Data points are now automatically provided in :class:`.ExperimentData` objects via the ``curve_data``
    artifact.
  - |
    Direct access to the curve fit summary in :class:`.ExperimentData` has moved from
    :meth:`.analysis_results` to :meth:`.artifacts`, where values are stored in the
    :attr:`~.ArtifactData.data` attribute of :class:`.ArtifactData` objects. For example, to access the
    chi-squared of the fit, ``expdata.analysis_results(0).chisq`` is deprecated in favor of
    ``expdata.artifacts("fit_summary").data.chisq``. In a future release, the curve fit summary
    will be removed from :meth:`.analysis_results` and the option ``return_fit_parameters`` will be
    removed. For more information on artifacts, see the :doc:`artifacts how-to </howtos/artifacts>`.

    Using numerical indices with :meth:`.ExperimentData.analysis_results`, including both integers and
    slices, is now deprecated. Access analysis results by analysis result name or ID instead.
