    The :class:`.MplDrawer` visualization backend has been upgraded so that
    it can take list of options for ``xlim``, ``ylim``, ``xval_unit``, ``yval_unit``,
    ``xval_unit_scale``, and ``yval_unit_scale``. New figure options 
    ``sharex`` and ``sharey`` are also added. The new options are used to unkink the
    configuration of sub axes, and default to ``True`` for backward compatibility.
    By disabling these options, an experiment author can write an analysis class that
    generates a multi-axes figure with different plot ranges.
