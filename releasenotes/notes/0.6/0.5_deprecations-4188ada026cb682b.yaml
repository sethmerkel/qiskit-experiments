    Several deprecated methods and options have been removed and will no longer work:

    * Passing the ``qubits`` keyword argument or an integer qubit index to experiments is no longer
      allowed. Use ``physical_qubits`` keyword argument with a sequence type input.
    * The ``scipy_linear_lstsq`` and ``scipy_gaussian_lstsq`` fitters for the
      :class:`.StateTomographyAnalysis` and :class:`.ProcessTomographyAnalysis`
      classes have been removed. Use the :func:`.cvxpy_linear_lstsq` 
      and :func:`.cvxpy_gaussian_lstsq` fitters instead.
    * Curve fit solvers ``curve_fit()`` and ``multi_curve_fit()`` as well as fit functions
      ``bloch_oscillation_x()``, ``bloch_oscillation_y()``, and ``bloch_oscillation_z()`` have been
      removed. Use the LMFIT library instead.
    * The ``flat_top_widths`` argument and experiment option of the
      :class:`.CrossResonanceHamiltonian` experiment and its subclass have been removed. Use
      ``durations`` instead.
    * The ``DumpedOscillationAnalysis`` class has been renamed to :class:`.DampedOscillationAnalysis`.
