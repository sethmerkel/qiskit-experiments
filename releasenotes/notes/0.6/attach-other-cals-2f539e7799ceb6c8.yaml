    A new method :meth:`~.Calibrations.has_template`
    has been added to :class:`.Calibrations`
    to check if a template schedule exists for a particular set of qubits.

    :class:`.FineXDragCal` and :class:`.EFRoughXSXAmplitudeCal` were updated to
    attach ``"sx"`` and ``"x"`` calibrations to their circuits, respectively.
    Previously, they only attached the ``"x"`` and ``"x12"`` calibrations that they
    were calibrating. See issue `#1158 <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-experiments/issues/1158>`_.
