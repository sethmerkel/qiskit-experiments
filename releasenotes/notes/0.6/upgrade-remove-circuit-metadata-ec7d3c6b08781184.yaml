    Removed unnecessary circuit metadata from the builtin experiment classes.
    Circuit metadata such as the associated qubit indices and experiment type 
    are separately stored in the experiment metadata, and never used in the analysis.
    Removal of unnecessary circuit metadata compresses the job payload and 
    thus is expected to benefit scalability.
