    Fixed :mod:`pickle` deserialization of :class:`.ExperimentData` objects.
    Previously, :class:`.ExperimentData` objects could be serialized and
    deserialized using Python's ``pickle`` module, but deserialized objects
    were not completely restored and an exception would be raised when doing
    some operations like running analysis on the restored object. See `#1326
    <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-experiments/pull/1326/files>`__.
