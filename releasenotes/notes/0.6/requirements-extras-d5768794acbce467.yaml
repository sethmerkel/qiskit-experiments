    A new set of optional dependencies have been split off from the developer dependencies and
    can be installed separately as ``qiskit-experiments[extras]``. These are packages that enable
    optional experiment features such as ``scikit-learn``-based discriminators. Qiskit Dynamics and
    Qiskit Aer have also been marked as optional in this manner.
