    The Qiskit Experiments 0.4 release includes major improvements to the :class:`.CurveAnalysis`
    class and other bug fixes and improvements. The database service has switched to the
    `qiskit-ibm-experiment <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-experiment>`_ provider.
    Several new data processing nodes have been added.
developer:
  - |
    The class :class:`.MockIQBackend` for testing has been updated to support
    multiple qubits. It now takes lists of IQ cluster centers and widths as input,
    and specific backends are now defined as subclasses of
    :class:`.MockIQExperimentHelper`.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes a bug where instantiating the
    :class:`.CrossResonanceHamiltonian` experiment without specifying the
    ``cr_gate`` and ``backend`` init kwargs raises an exception.
  - |
    Fixes a visualization error in the figure produced during analysis of
    :class:`.CrossResonanceHamiltonian` when multi-canvas plotting mode is enabled.
  - |
    Fixes an issue with marginalization of kerneled and discriminated memory in
    :class:`.CompositeAnalysis` not working correctly. This fixes
    :class:`.ParallelExperiment` not working correctly for level-1 measurement
    data.
  - |
    Fixes a bug with JSON serialization of :class:`.ExperimentData` due to
    Qiskit ``backend`` and ``service`` objects not being JSON serializable. These
    properties are now set to ``None`` in the serialized experiment data.
