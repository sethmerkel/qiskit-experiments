    Do not adjust timing constraints in experiments :class:`.T1`,
    :class:`.T2Hahn`, :class:`.T2Ramsey`, and :class:`.RamseyXY`. This
    adjustment was needed to supply missing timing constraints information for
    IBM backends but is not needed now and can lead to problems (see `#881
    <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-experiments/issues/881>`).
