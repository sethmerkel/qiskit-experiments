    Experiment :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.CrossResonanceHamiltonian`
    and its subclasses have been upgraded. Now its instance can generate circuits without
    setting backend for just checking experiment sequence. The sequence with actual parameters
    is generated after the backend is set. In addition, now experiments can take ``cr_gate``
    in the constractor which is ``Gate`` type subclass taking a single parameter (flat-top width).
    If one inputs a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.HamiltonianGate` subclass with
    cross resonance Hamiltonian, experiment can be simulated with Aer QASM simulator.
