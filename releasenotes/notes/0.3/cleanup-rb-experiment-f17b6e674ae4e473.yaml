features:
  - |
    The curve fit parameter guess function :func:`~.guess.rb_decay` has been added. 
    This improves the initial parameter estimation of randomized benchmark experiments.
upgrade:
  - |
    The computation of error per gates (EPGs) from EPC in :class:`RBAnalysis` has been upgraded.
    To compute these values from a single EPC value obtained by the experiment,
    we should provide a guess of contribution per basis gate to the depolarization.
    This ratio has been extracted from backend properties with 
    :meth:`RBUtils.get_error_dict_from_backend`, but this approach may result in 
    unreproducible EPG outcomes under certain circumstances.
    See `PR 762 <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-experiments/pull/762>`_ for more details.
    Not this error ratio is provided from a hard-coded lookup table, 
    and the user can still provide custom values with analysis option ``gate_error_ratio``.
    One can skip computation of EPGs by setting the option to ``False``.
  - |
    :class:`RBAnalysis` has been upgraded to compute corrected EPC for 2Q RB.
    When the analysis option ``epg_1_qubit`` is provided,
    it returns two EPG analysis results, with and without correction for
    underlying single qubit depolarization channels.
    New result is added under the name ``EPC_corrected``.
deprecations:
  - |
    Calling :class:`RBUtils` methods have been deprecated and will be removed after 0.4.
