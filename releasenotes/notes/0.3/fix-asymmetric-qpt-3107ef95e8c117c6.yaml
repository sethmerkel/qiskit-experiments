    Fixed a bug with the :class:`.ProcessTomography` where the default target
    channel analysis option was computed incorrectly if not all qubits were
    prepared and measured, and the preparations and measurements were applied
    to different subsets of qubits.

    See `Issue 758 <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-experiments/issues/758>`_
    for details.

    Fixed a bug with the :class:`.ProcessTomographyAnalysis` where analysis
    would raise an exception if the number of prepared and measurement qubits
    are not equal.

    See `Issue 757 <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-experiments/issues/757>`_
    for details.
