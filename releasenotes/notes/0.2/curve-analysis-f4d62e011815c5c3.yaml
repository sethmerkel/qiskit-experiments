    Curve analysis may have imperfection in the uncertainty propagation computation.
    Fit paramters consist of the nominal part and standard error, however,
    the correlation of these paramters are not precisely taken into account.
    This sometimes result in the overestimation of the confidence interval of fit curves,
    or overestimation of the standard error of some analysis values computed with
    multiple fitting parameters. This issue will be solved in the version 0.3.
    See `qiskit-experiments/#551 <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-experiments/pull/551>`_

    There have been several changes to the
    :class:`qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.CurveAnalysis` class which may
    effect developers implementing experiments using curve analysis.

    These include:

    * Default data pre-processing for curve fit data has been added to
      :class:`~qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.CurveAnalysis`. The input data
      to the analysis is averaged over the same x values and sorted by x values.
      This processing is necessary to correctly analyze an experimental data which
      has duplicate x values.
    
    * The handling of user provided initial guesses and fit boundaries has been
      changed so that subclasses no longer need to use user provided option values.
      Propagation of user values is now handled by the base class.
      
    * The subclass method name to provide these initial guesses for curve fitting
      has bee changed from ``_setup_fitting`` to
      :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.CurveAnalysis._generate_fit_guesses`.
      See the documentation for more details.

    * Tick labels and fit parameters shown in the fit result plot generated by
      :class:`qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.CurveAnalysis`
      subclasses are formatted with unit with prefactor scalings.
      For example, 1e7 can now be displayed as 10 MHz.

      To enable this change, all experiments using
      :class:`~qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.CurveAnalysis` or a subclass
      analysis class should set analysis options ``xval_unit`` and ``yval_unit``.

    A ``model_description`` fields has been added to the
    :class:`qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.SeriesDef` dataclass. This field
    stores the string representation of the fit model of the curve and will be
    stored in the experiments analysis result extra field.
