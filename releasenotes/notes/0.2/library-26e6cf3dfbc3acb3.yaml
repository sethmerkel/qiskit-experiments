    Added a collection of experiments for performing single-qubit gate
    :mod:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization` and
    :mod:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration`. The new experiments are

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.Rabi`: 
      This experiment scans the amplitude of a pulse and measures the qubit
      population. This allows us to determine the amplitude that creates,
      for example, an ``X`` gate and/or a ``SX`` gate.
      
    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.RoughXSXAmplitudeCal`:
      The calibration version of :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.Rabi`.
      It extracts the amplitudes needed to implement an ``X`` gate an a ``SX`` gate.
      This type of calibration is a rough amplitude calibration since the resulting
      parameter value is typically not very precises.

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineAmplitude`: This experiment repeats
      a rotation a variable number of times to amplify over- and under-rotations.
      The resulting ping-pong pattern in the qubit population is fit to determine
      the error in the rotation angle.
      This experiment has specializations for X 
      (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineXAmplitude`) and SX 
      (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineSXAmplitude`) gates.

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.FineAmplitudeCal`: The calibration version
      of :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineAmplitude`.
      It will update the amplitude of the pulse according to the measurred deviation.
      This experiment has specializations for X 
      (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.FineXAmplitudeCal`) and SX 
      (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.FineSXAmplitudeCal`) gates.

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.RoughDrag`:
      This experiment scans the DRAG parameter of a repeated
      sequence of rotation and anti-rotation. If the DRAG parameter does not have
      the correct value phase errors will accumulate and the repeated sequece of
      gates will not return the qubit to the ground state.
      
    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.RoughDragCal`: The calibration version of
      :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.RoughDrag`.

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineDrag`: This experiment iterates the
      gate sequence Rp - Rm where Rp is a rotation around an axis and Rm is the same
      rotation but in the opposite direction. This sequence amplifies phase errors due
      to the presence of higher excited states.
      This experiment has specializations for X 
      (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineXDrag`) and SX 
      (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineSXDrag`) gates.
    
    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.FineDragCal`: The calibration version of
      :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineDrag`.
      This will update the DRAG parameter in the instance of the
      :class:`:class:`~qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.Calibrations` class.
      This experiment has specializations for X 
      (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.FineXDragCal`) and SX 
      (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.FineSXDragCal`) gates.

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.QubitSpectroscopy`: This experiment
      performs spectroscopy by applying a frequency shift to a long pulse. This experiment
      is typically used to identify the resonance frequency of the qubit.
      
    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.RoughFrequencyCal` the calibration
      version of :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.QubitSpectroscopy`.
      This gives us a first rough estimate of the qubits frequency.

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.RamseyXY`: This experiment
      performs a Ramsey-XY experiment which allows us to measure the frequency of the qubit.
      This experiment is sensitive to the sign of the frequency offset from the main transition.
      It is a more precise measurement than spectroscopy.
      
    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.FrequencyCal`: This is the calibration
      version of :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.RamseyXY`.

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineFrequency`:
      This experiment performs an error amplifying sequence to measure the frequency of the qubit.
      This is done with delay instructions with a variable length and RZ gates.
      
    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.FineFrequencyCal`:
      This is the calibration version of
      :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineFrequency`.

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.HalfAngle`:
      This experiment measures the amount by which the SX and X gates are not parallel.
      Such errors can occur due to phase errors. For example,
      the non-linearities in the mixer's skew for :math:`\pi/2` pulses may be
      different from the :math:`\pi` pulse.

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.HalfAngleCal`:
      This is the calibration version of
      :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.HalfAngle`.

    Two cross-resonance Hamiltonian tomography experiments have been
    added to the :mod:`qiskit_experiments.library`.

    * :class:`qiskit_experiments.library.CrossResonanceHamiltonian`
    * :class:`qiskit_experiments.library.EchoedCrossResonanceHamiltonian`

    These experiments estimates the IX, IY, IZ, ZX, ZY, ZZ Hamiltonian term
    coefficients of the cross-resonance Hamiltonian, using either a single-tone
    cross-resonance gate
    (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.CrossResonanceHamiltonian`)
    or an echoed cross-resonance gate
    (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.EchoedResonanceHamiltonian`).
  - |
    Added a :class:`qiskit_experiments.library.ReadoutAngle` characterization
    experiment. This experiment computes the average of the angles of the IQ
    clusters of the ground and excited states.
  - |
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.StandardRb` and
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.InterleavedRb` experiments now
    compute error as part of the error-per-gate computation.
  
upgrade:
  - |
    All :mod:`qiskit_experiments.library` experiments have been changed to work
    with fixed SI units: `Hz` for frequency, `seconds` for delays, and backend
    `dt` for pulse widths and durations.
    Previous experiments with ``unit`` kwargs in their init functions have had
    this kwarg removed.
  - |
    The ``qubits`` intitialization argument for
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.StandardRb`,
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.InterleavedRb`,
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.QuantumVolume`,
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.StateTomography`,
    and 
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.ProcessTomography`
    no longer accepts interger values for specifying a range of qubits.
    and  must now contain an explicit sequence of qubits.
  - |
    The behavior of the ``seed`` initialization kwarg of the
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.StandardRB`,
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.InterleavedStandardRB`,
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.QuantumVolume` experiments has
    been modified.

    In the new version the ``seed`` value is used as to initialize a Numpy
    random number generator object as ``numpy.random.default_rng(seed=seed)``
    each time the experiments ``circuits`` method is called. This change means
    that using a fixed seed value will result in the same circuits being
    generated each time an experiment is run, if no other
    experiment options are changed.

    To generate different new random circuits each time an experiment is run
    the (default) value of ``seed=None`` should be used. To reproduce
    equivalent functionality to the previous version behavior of differnet
    circuits being generated each time ``run`` is called with a fixed seed
    you must now set a new fixed seed value between each call to ``run``
    using ``experiment.set_experiment_options(seed=value)``.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed a bug in :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.StandardRB` and
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.InterleavedRB` where the variance in
    the estimated error per Clifford did not scale correctly with the number
    of sampled RB sequences.

    See `Issue 428 <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-experiments/issues/428>`_
    for details.
