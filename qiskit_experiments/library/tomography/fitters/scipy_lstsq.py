    Overview
        This fitter reconstructs the maximum-likelihood estimate by using
        :func:`scipy.linalg.lstsq` to minimize the least-squares negative log
        likelihood function

        .. math::
            \hat{\rho}
                &= -\mbox{argmin }\log\mathcal{L}{\rho} \\
                &= \mbox{argmin }\sum_i w_i^2(\mbox{Tr}[E_j\rho] - \hat{p}_i)^2 \\
                &= \mbox{argmin }\|W(Ax - y) \|_2^2

        where

        - :math:`A = \sum_j |j \rangle\!\langle\!\langle E_j|` is the matrix of measured
          basis elements.
        - :math:`W = \sum_j w_j|j\rangle\!\langle j|` is an optional diagonal weights
          matrix if an optional weights vector is supplied.
        - :math:`y = \sum_j \hat{p}_j |j\langle` is the vector of estimated measurement
          outcome probabilites for each basis element.
        - :math:`x = |\rho\rangle\!\rangle` is the vectorized density matrix.

    .. note::

        Linear least-squares constructs the full basis matrix :math:`A` as a dense
        numpy array so should not be used for than 5 or 6 qubits. For larger number
        of qubits try the
        :func:`~qiskit_experiments.library.tomography.fitters.linear_inversion`
        fitter function.

        weights: Optional array of weights for least squares objective.

    Raises:
        AnalysisError: If the fitted vector is not a square matrix

    Returns:

        This function calls :func:`scipy_linear_lstsq` with a Gaussian weights
        vector. Refer to its documentation for additional details.

    Overview
        This fitter uses the :func:`scipy_linear_lstsq` fitter to reconstructs
        the maximum-likelihood estimate of the Gaussian weighted least-squares
        log-likelihood function

        .. math::

                = \|W(Ax -y) \|_2^2

    Additional Details
        The Gaussian weights are estimated from the observed frequency and shot data
        using

        .. math::

            \sigma_i &= \sqrt{\frac{q_i(1 - q_i)}{n_i}} \\
            q_i &= \frac{f_i + \beta}{n_i + K \beta}

        where :math:`q_i` are hedged probabilities which are rescaled to avoid
        0 and 1 values using the "add-beta" rule, with :math:`\beta=0.5`, and
        :math:`K=2^m` the number of measurement outcomes for each basis measurement.
