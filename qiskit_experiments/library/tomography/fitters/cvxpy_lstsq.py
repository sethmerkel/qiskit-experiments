    r"""Constrained weighted linear least-squares tomography fitter.

    Overview
        This fitter reconstructs the maximum-likelihood estimate by using
        ``cvxpy`` to minimize the constrained least-squares negative log
        likelihood function

        .. math::
            \hat{\rho}
                &= -\mbox{argmin }\log\mathcal{L}{\rho} \\
                &= \mbox{argmin }\sum_i w_i^2(\mbox{Tr}[E_j\rho] - \hat{p}_i)^2 \\
                &= \mbox{argmin }\|W(Ax - y) \|_2^2

        subject to

        - *Positive-semidefinite* (``psd=True``): :math:`\rho \gg 0` is constrained
          to be a postive-semidefinite matrix.
        - *Trace* (``trace=t``): :math:`\mbox{Tr}(\rho) = t` is constained to have
          the specified trace.
        - *Trace preserving* (``trace_preserving=True``): When performing process
          tomography the Choi-state :math:`\rho` represents is contstained to be
          trace preserving.

        where

        - :math:`A` is the matrix of measurement operators
          :math:`A = \sum_i |i\rangle\!\langle\!\langle M_i|`
        - :math:`y` is the vector of expectation value data for each projector
          corresponding to estimates of :math:`b_i = Tr[M_i \cdot x]`.
        - :math:`x` is the vectorized density matrix (or Choi-matrix) to be fitted
          :math:`x = |\rho\rangle\\!\rangle`.

    .. note:

        Various solvers can be called in CVXPY using the `solver` keyword
        argument. When ``psd=True`` the optimization problem is a case of a
        *semidefinite program* (SDP) and requires a SDP compatible solver
        for CVXPY. CVXPY includes an SDP compatible solver `SCS`` but it
        is recommended to install the the open-source ``CVXOPT`` solver
        or one of the supported commercial solvers. See the `CVXPY
        documentation
        <https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/advanced/index.html#solve-method-options>`_
        for more information on solvers.

    .. note::

        Linear least-squares constructs the full basis matrix :math:`A` as a dense
        numpy array so should not be used for than 5 or 6 qubits. For larger number
        of qubits try the
        :func:`~qiskit_experiments.library.tomography.fitters.linear_inversion`

        preparation_qubits: Optional, the physical qubits that were prepared.

                            N preparated qubits.

             semidefinite (default: True)
        trace_preserving: Enforce the fitted matrix to be
