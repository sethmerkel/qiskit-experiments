    Overview
        This fitter uses linear inversion to reconstructs the maximum-likelihood
        estimate of the least-squares log-likelihood function

        .. math::
            \hat{\rho}
                &= -\mbox{argmin }\log\mathcal{L}{\rho} \\
                &= \mbox{argmin }\sum_i (\mbox{Tr}[E_j\rho] - \hat{p}_i)^2 \\
                &= \mbox{argmin }\|Ax - y \|_2^2

        where

        * :math:`A = \sum_j |j \rangle\!\langle\!\langle E_j|` is the matrix of measured
          basis elements.
        * :math:`y = \sum_j \hat{p}_j |j\rangle` is the vector of estimated measurement
          outcome probabilites for each basis element.
        * :math:`x = |\rho\rangle\!\rangle` is the vectorized density matrix.

    Additional Details
        The linear inversion solution is given by

        .. math::
            \hat{\rho} = \sum_i \hat{p}_i D_i

        where measurement probabilities :math:`\hat{p}_i = f_i / n_i` are estimated
        from the observed count frequencies :math:`f_i` in :math:`n_i` shots for each
        basis element :math:`i`, and :math:`D_i` is the *dual basis* element constructed
        from basis :math:`\{E_i\}` via:

        .. math:

            |D_i\rangle\!\rangle = M^{-1}|E_i \rangle\!\rangle \\
            M = \sum_j |E_j\rangle\!\rangle\!\langle\!\langle E_j|

    .. note::

        The Linear inversion fitter treats the input measurement and preparation
        bases as local bases and constructs separate 1-qubit dual basis for each
        individual qubit.

        Linear inversion is only possible if the input bases are local and a spanning
        set for the vector space of the reconstructed matrix
        (*tomographically complete*). If the basis is not tomographically complete
        the :func:`~qiskit_experiments.library.tomography.fitters.scipy_linear_lstsq`
        or :func:`~qiskit_experiments.library.tomography.fitters.cvxpy_linear_lstsq`
        function can be used to solve the same objective function via
        least-squares optimization.

    Args:
        outcome_data: basis outcome frequency data.
        shot_data: basis outcome total shot data.
        measurement_data: measurement basis indice data.
        preparation_data: preparation basis indice data.
        measurement_basis: the tomography measurement basis.
        preparation_basis: the tomography preparation basis.
        measurement_qubits: Optional, the physical qubits that were measured.
                            If None they are assumed to be [0, ..., M-1] for
                            M measured qubits.
        preparation_qubits: Optional, the physical qubits that were prepared.
                            If None they are assumed to be [0, ..., N-1] for
                            N preparated qubits.

    Raises:
        AnalysisError: If the fitted vector is not a square matrix

    Returns:
        The fitted matrix rho.
